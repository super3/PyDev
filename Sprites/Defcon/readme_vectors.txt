Second Release (18.10.2006)

- New bomber Icon (old one is still there as "bomber1.bmp", "bomber1_blur.bmp" and "smallbomber1.bmp" in case you like it better)
- Most GUI-icons including the mouse pointer have now been "vectorized"
- SAM-icon slightly modified

About:
------

This Mod changes most of the icons in the game to simplified vector graphics. 
Also included is a replacement for the kremlin-font.

Install:
--------

Extract/Copy the contents of the zip-file into a "data" subdir in your DEFCON-directory.

Known Problems:
---------------

The kremlin-font is incomplete, but complete enough for most displays and texts 
in the game. Using it for the UI or the buttons might be problematic.

Have fun!
